# Configuration_puzzle_solver

# Clock:

The first puzzle is a clock. The clock only has an hour hand, where N is the number of hours, which can be turned 
forward or backward one hour at a time (called a step). There are three parameters associated with the clock:

    The number of hours, an integer N
    The start time, an integer from 1..N
    The goal time, an integer from 1..N

The program is run from the command line as:

   ` g++ clock.cpp`</br>
   `./a.out {hours} {start} {goal}`

The program displays,the shortest number of steps it takes to get from the start to the goal
time. For example:

  `./a.out 15 2 14`
    `Step 0:  2`
    `Step 1:  1`
    `Step 2:  15`
    `Step 3:  14`


# Water Puzzle:

Water puzzle accepts 3 arguments from command line.

first argument: goal quantity
second argument: quantity of container 1
third argument: quantity of container 2

The program is run from the command line as:

  `g++ water.cpp`
  `./a.out {goal} {quantity of jug1} {quantity of jug2}`



	
# LLoyd puzzle:

Lloyd accepts an input file which has input configuration and goal configuration given as first argument and writes to output file given as second argument.

If the first argument is "-" then input is read from from console.
If the second argument is "-" then output is displayed on console.
If the both the arguments are "-" then input and output is read and displayed by console.

The program is run from the command line as:

  `g++ lloyd.cpp`
	`./a.out inputfile outputfile`
